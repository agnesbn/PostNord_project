# PostNord project
_Exam project for Computational Linguistics Spring 2023_

## How to use the code
- Before running any of the code, please download the data from [this Kaggle-page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicklasstiborgm/reviews-of-postnords-trustpilot-page) and add it to the `in`-folder.
- Then go into the `notebooks`-folder, open the `preprocessing.ipynb`-notebook and run all the code chunks in the notebook. This should complete any necessary preprocessing of the data and save a cleaned and balanced dataset, which can be used for further analysis, in the `in`-folder.
    - _If you want to skip this step, you can already find the output from this notebook (`balanced_dataset.csv`) in the `in`-folder.
- Then open and run all the code in `postnord_classification.ipynb`, and you will get the different output seen in the exam paper.
    - _This might take a while!_
